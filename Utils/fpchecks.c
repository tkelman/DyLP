/*
  This code is meant to compile and link using the command

    cc -lm fpchecks.c
  
  where cc should be replaced with the name of your local C compiler. Asking
  for libmath should be safe (if redundant) in any C environment.

  The first thing that this file does is to try and identify the computing
  environment and set some macro names that bonsaiG/dylp will recognize. The
  approach here is to look for macro names defined by the programming
  environment.

  Environments known to bonsaiG/dylp are:

    * Sun Solaris/Workshop: __SUNPRO_C => __DYLP_SUNWspro
    * Sun Solaris/Gnu: __GNUC__, __sun => __DYLP_SUN
    * Other Gnu: __GNUC__ => _GNU_SOURCE
  
  _GNU_SOURCE is meaningful to GCC compilers (features.h). You'd think
  _ISOC99_SOURCE would suffice to bring in all IEEE FP support functions in
  the Gnu environment, but that doesn't seem to hold uniformly.  _GNU_SOURCE
  seems like overkill, but it's robust.  Recently (as of 3.0?) IEEE 754
  floating point support looks to be much improved. When it looks like we can
  count on seeing a GCC environment at 3.0 or later, the whole issue should
  be reviewed.

  __DYLP_SUNWspro and __DYLP_SUN are meaningful only in osidylp code.  It's
  likely that bonsaiG/dylp should be more fussy about the hardware in a Linux
  environment. Your mileage may vary.

  Once the environment is settled, the code checks various characteristics of
  the floating point computation environment and reports on the proper values
  for macro definitions in the dylp makefile. Specifically, we try to
  determine:

    * If your machine is big-endian or little-endian. bonsaiG/dylp assume a
      big-endian machine by default (a consequence of growing up on SPARC
      hardware).

    * The extent to which your machine supports IEEE floating point `special'
      values used by bonsaiG/dylp: infinity (Inf) and not-a-number (NaN).
  
  In case it needs repeating: big-endian machines store the most significant
  bits of a multibyte number in the the lower numbered memory locations (big
  end first).  little-endian machines store the most significant bits in the
  higher numbered memory location. Given the usual conventions for writing
  numbers (most significant digits to the left) and writing memory locations
  (lower numbered addresses to the left), multibyte numbers tend to look
  scrambled when printed out a byte at a time on a little-endian machine.

  NOTE: There is one more endian type recognised by GCC, PDP_ENDIAN. dylp
  isn't prepared to support this. It also seems to be rare.

  finite and fpclass functions

  finite() checks for IEEE infinity. fpclass is a more general function that
  returns the class of the FP number (normalized, denormalized, zero, infinity,
  NaN, with variations).

  In the Sun environment, finite and fpclass are defined in ieeefp.h. Be
  aware that fpclass returns a 10-value enum, fpclass_t. There's another
  function, fp_class, which returns a 5-value enum, fp_class_type. This
  function is only found in the Workshop file sunmath.h. BonsaiG and dylp
  expect the 10-value model.

  Sun/Solaris typedef's an enum for IEEE FP number classification codes. GNU C
  gets clever, and uses an unnamed enum to create integer values for #define's.
  Pretty much everyone else sticks with simple #define's. Sun/Solaris names the
  classification function fpclass. Others call the function fpclassify.

  There's an uglier problem. Some environments (Sun, HP, for example) define
  10 FP number class codes, separating each major category (normalised, zero,
  infinity, denormalised) into two codes by sign and separating not-a-number
  into quiet and signalling NaN. Others don't (a far more sensible approach in
  the case of sign, arguable for NaN). Unfortunately, to make the strong bounds
  consistency checks in bound_utils.c work in both circumstances, they need
  to be rewritten using if-then-else instead of case. With any luck you
  shouldn't need them, and if you're working at that level, you're capable of
  the necessary rewrite on your own. The following definitions take care of
  making sure FP_QNAN and FP_SNAN are available, which is all bonsaiG needs in
