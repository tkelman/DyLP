***                         DOWNLOAD                               ***
**********************************************************************

You can obtain the source code for the DyLP package in two ways:

1. Obtain the source directly from the COIN-OR subversion repository
   (recommended).  For this you needs the program 'svn' installed on
   your machine, and output of "svn --version" must contain 
   "handles 'https' scheme".

   Assuming that you want to download the code into a subdirectory
   "COIN-DyLP", you type

   svn co https://projects.coin-or.org/svn/DyLP/trunk Coin-DyLP

2. Download the tarball from http://www.coin-or.org/Tarballs/DyLP and
   extract it, for example, with

   gunzip DyLP_2006Jun07.tgz
   tar xvf DyLP_2006Jun07.tar

   (Here "2006Jun07" is of course replaced by the string in the
   tarball you downloaded.)

   More detailed download instructions can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-download

**********************************************************************
***                       CONFIGURATION                            ***
**********************************************************************

Go into the directory that you just downloaded or extracted (e.g.,
Coin-DyLP or DyLP_2006Jun07).  Then you type

   ./configure

Note that you might have to specify additional options, in case you
don't want to use the default choices that configure makes (e.g.,
compilers).  Please visit

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-configure

and the DyLP Trac page

   https://projects.coin-or.org/DyLP

for more information.

If everything went fine, you will see at the end of the output

   "Main configuration of DyLP successful"

**********************************************************************
***                COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION                    ***
**********************************************************************

In the directory where you ran the configure script:

1. Compile the code by typing

   make

2. To test if the code works, you can type

   make test

3. To install the code, you type

   make install

   After this, you will find the executables, libraries and header
   files in the "bin", "lib" and "include" subdirectory, respectively.

More information on the compilation and installation can be found at

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-compile

**********************************************************************
***                     USING THE LIBRARIES                        ***
**********************************************************************

Now you can link your own code with the installed libraries.  You can
find examples in the

   DyLP/examples/

subdirectory. To build dylp's example drivers, cd to DyLP/examples and
read the README file there. It contains detailed instructions.

   https://projects.coin-or.org/BuildTools/wiki/user-examples


**********************************************************************
***                     DOCUMENTATION				   ***
**********************************************************************

  In the DyLP/doc directory, you'll find a longish (about 90 pages) tech
  report (PostScript and PDF) which explains the algorithms used in dylp and
  the options and interfaces that are available. The code itself is heavily
  commented.  Section 12, `Dynamic Simplex', (in particular, Fig. 3) is your
  best bet for a high-level overview of the dynamic simplex algorithm.

  OsiDylp, the OSI interface layer for dylp, is commented using doxygen
  conventions, but dylp is not (yet).

  LaTeX source for the tech report is included, should you want to build the
  documentation from scratch. There's no guarantee this will go smoothly, but
  your chances are fairly good if you have a modern TeX distribution. See the
  README in DyLP/doc.
